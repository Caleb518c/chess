ToDo: 
  Short term:
    - Allow computer to play checkmate <br>
    - Provide message for when checkmate is played
    - Make the last move highlighted allways show for black (for some reason it doesn't highlight blacks last move sometime)

  Long term: 
    - Allow multiple squares to be highlighted at once
    - Allow the white piece to be placed down before the computer starts to think of a move
