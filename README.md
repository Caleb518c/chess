ToDo: <br>
  Short term:<br>
    - Allow computer to play checkmate <br>
    - Provide message for when checkmate is played<br>
    - Make the last move highlighted allways show for black (for some reason it doesn't highlight blacks last move sometime)<br>
    - Fix promotion <br>
    <br>
  Long term: <br>
    - Allow multiple squares to be highlighted at once<br>
    - Allow the white piece to be placed down before the computer starts to think of a move<br>
